# cpp-tutorial-syllabus
This is repository to learn basic CPP . Here we have a good syllabus and sample programs for students and professionals to getting started with cpp


## 1.  Basical operations and arithemetical examples

1. `Helloworld program `
   
    Print helloworld in the console using cpp

2. `Cin and Cout familarisation`
    write a program to take an input number from the user and print it in the console .
3. `Basic arithemetical operations `
    
    3.1 Write program to add two numbers entered by the user 

        Eg :

        PROGRAM TO ADD TWO NUMBERS

        Enter first number : 2
        Enter second number : 10
        Output : 12

    3.2 Write a program for subtracting two numbers from the user

    3.3 Multiplication

    3.4 Division

    3.5 write a program to devide two numbers entered by the user . Store and display both quatient and reminder 


## 2.  IF LOOP FAMILIARIZATION

1. `basic if `
    
    write a basic program using if loop to print

    "Value is 1 " if the user input is 1

    "Value is not 1 " else


2.  `compare two inputs`

    write a program to take 2 inputs from the user

    If the entered 2 inputs are 5 print two inputs are 5 .
    Else print error

    NOTE :

    ```cpp
    int a =1;
    int b =1;
    if ( (a==1) && (b==1) )
    {
        // if and b equals 1 the code enter this loop ..
    }
    ```

    And condition checks if both of the conditions are true ..
    Study basic operation of AND (&&) operator .
3. `else if ladder concepts `

    write a program to input a number from a user .

    If the number is greater than 50 print "it is greater than 50"

    If the number is less than 50 print "it is less than 50 "

    If the number equals 50 print "its is 50"

4. ` If else advanced  `

    write a program to find the grades of students in accordance with their entered marks


    Notes :

    Marks are out of 100 .

    For marks from 90 to 100 grade : A+

    80-90 : A

    70-80 : B+

    80-90 : B

    70-80 : C+

    60-70 : C

    .
    .
    .
    .

    If mark is under D print student is failed

    ( use the concepts of : if , < , > ,&& )
    
5. ` odd or even `
   Write a program to print even if the entered number is even and also need to print odd if the entered number is an odd number . 
   
   
6. `OR boolean familiarization`
   Write a program to print yes if entered number is 1 or 100 
   else print no
7. `if-loop advanced conditions`
   Write a program to print "it is a negative number " if the user enter a negative number number . 
   else we need to add the entered number with 3 and after that check if the result is an odd number or an even number . 
   If the numbre is odd print " the number is : (print the number here) and it is an odd number "
   else print it is an even number. 
   NOTE: 
      Do not write full code at once . Do it step by step . First check the first if contition and is it working or not . you can use cout function to check is the logic working correctly or not.
      
      After that do the second section and check if its working or not .
