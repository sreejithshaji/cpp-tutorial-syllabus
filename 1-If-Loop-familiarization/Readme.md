## 2.  IF LOOP FAMILIARIZATION

1. `basic if `
    
    write a basic program using if loop to print

    "Value is 1 " if the user input is 1

    "Value is not 1 " else


2.  `compare two inputs`

    write a program to take 2 inputs from the user

    If the entered 2 inputs are 5 print two inputs are 5 .
    Else print error

    NOTE :

    ```cpp
    int a =1;
    int b =1;
    if ( (a==1) && (b==1) )
    {
        // if and b equals 1 the code enter this loop ..
    }
    ```

    And condition checks if both of the conditions are true ..
    Study basic operation of AND (&&) operator .
3. `else if ladder concepts `

    write a program to input a number from a user .

    If the number is greater than 50 print "it is greater than 50"

    If the number is less than 50 print "it is less than 50 "

    If the number equals 50 print "its is 50"

4. ` If else advanced  `

    write a program to find the grades of students in accordance with their entered marks


    Notes :

    Marks are out of 100 .

    For marks from 90 to 100 grade : A+

    80-90 : A

    70-80 : B+

    80-90 : B

    70-80 : C+

    60-70 : C

    .
    .
    .
    .

    If mark is under D print student is failed

    ( use the concepts of : if , < , > ,&& )
